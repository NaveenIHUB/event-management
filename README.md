1. Admin Journey: Creating and Managing Events
Admin Login
The admin logs into the application using their credentials.
Add Event
The admin navigates to the "Create Event" page.
Fills in event details (title, description, date, location, etc.).
Submits the form to create a new event.
The event is saved to the database and becomes visible in the admin’s dashboard.
View Own Events
The admin can view a list of all events they have created.
Each event entry may include options to edit or delete the event.

2. User Journey: Viewing and Booking Event Tickets
Browse Events
Any user (logged in or guest, depending on your app’s rules) can view the list of all available events.
View Event Details
The user clicks on an event to see more information (description, date, location, etc.).
Book Ticket
The user selects the number of tickets and proceeds to book.
The booking is confirmed, and the user receives a confirmation (via email or on-screen).
